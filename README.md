# WorkReminder - This is something I wrote for work. The app automatically logins into my idiot employer's website and gets the current schedule. And based on the hours set by the gestapo, it will automatically set the alarm on my phone 20 minutes before the start of my shift. 

Some other things it can do is that it only checks for the new schedule once a week. I do this to save bandwith. I also do this because my phone carrier likes to randomly drop my signal. I also can change the alarm notification via a preference GUI.
