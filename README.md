# WorkReminder - This is something I wrote for work. The Android phone app automatically logins into my <s>idiot</s> employer's website and gets the current schedule. And based on the hours set by the gestapo, it will automatically set the alarm on my phone 20 minutes before the start of my shift. 

# Some other things it can do is that it only checks for the new schedule once a week. I do this to save bandwidth.  Also because my phone carrier sucks dick by randomly dropping my signal. In addition I can change the alarm notification via a preference GUI and override my schedule in the event that I want to start earlier, later, or that I don't want to work at all. The latter is meant for those days when it's really nice outside -). 

# Now, as for the coding itself. Some it was automatically generated by the IDE and some of it was copy and pasted from the Android docs. And part of the time algorithm was taken from an elementary grade school book. More to the point, I translated the steps found in this book into the corresponding algorithm since your typical 4th grade math/science book doesn't talk about computer algorithms.
