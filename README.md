# WorkReminder - This is something I wrote for work. The app automatically logins into my idiot employer's website and gets the current schedule. And based on the hours set by the gestapo, it will automatically set the alarm on my phone 20 minutes before the start of my shift. 

# Some other things it can do is that it only checks for the new schedule once a week. I do this to save bandwidth.  Also because my phone carrier likes to randomly drop my signal. In addition I can change the alarm notification via a preference GUI and override my schedule in the event that I want to start earlier, later, or that I don't want to work at all. The latter is meant for those days when it's really nice outside -).
